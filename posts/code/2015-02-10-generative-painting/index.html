Each ring is generated using only one thread of a particular color, randomly walking in circle, like a silkworm making its cocoon. When the rings become closer to each other, the thread of a ring can jump to another ring, creating a connection and blending their two colors. When the rings are very close to each other, the three threads navigate over the three rings, making a figure emerge.

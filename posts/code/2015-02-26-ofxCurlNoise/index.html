<p>Curl noise is a faster alternative to simulation for animating fluids, developped by Bridson et al.
It's a procedural method based on simplex noise that gives a good control over the fluid.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/elaye/ofxCurlNoise" target="_blank">ofxCurlNoise</a> is an addon that offers the possibility to create a particle system and apply a curl noise to it, producing nice fluid-like movements.
The code for the curl noise comes from <a href="https://github.com/dli/flow" target="_blank">dli/flow</a>.</p>

<p>The motion of the particles and the curl noise are calculated with a compute shader, ensuring a fast computation. Since this addon uses compute shaders and OpenGL 4.3, it is only compatible with openFrameworks 0.9.0.</p>

<p>There are still a lot of things to add to this addon, for instance, solid boundaries or some kind of wind effect.</p>

<p>Here is a demo of the addon:</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" target="_blank">ofxMarkovChain</a> is an addon for openFrameworks that allows you to use Markov chains in a simple way.

A <a href="https://github.com/elaye/ofxMarkovChain" target="_blank">Markov chain</a> is a mathematical system that includes a certain number of states. The transition from one state to another is determined by a probability. An interesting property of Markov chains is that the next transition only depends on the current state, thus making them memoryless. Here is a state diagram of a simple Markov chain with 2 states:

If the system is in the state \(A\), then the probability to stay in that state is \(0.3\) and the probability to be in state \(B\) is \(0.7\). Now, this system can be represented as a matrix:

\[
	P = \begin{bmatrix}
0.3 & 0.7 \\
0.9 & 0.1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

You can notice that in order for the Markov chain to be coherent, the sum of the coefficients of each row of the matrix must be equal to \(1\). 

An example provided with <a href="https://github.com/elaye/ofxMarkovChain" target="_blank">ofxMarkovChain</a> is a random walker. The walker uses a Markov chain to choose in which direction to go next. The Markov chain has 4 states, each state corresponding to a direction: up, down, left or right.

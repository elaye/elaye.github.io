<p> ofxTouchBoard is an openFrameworks addon for receiving data from the <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/" target="_blank">Bare Conductive</a> Touch Board.
You need to upload the <a href="https://github.com/BareConductive/mpr121/tree/public/MPR121/Examples/DataStream" target="_blank">DataStream</a> program on your Touch Board for the addon to work.</p>

<p>The addon usage is pretty simple. You first setup the port on which your Touch Board is connected (or don't and the addon will ask you at runtime, showing you a list of available devices).
Then you call an <code>update</code> method every frame and that's it. The addon gives you access to a vector containing the data sent by the Touch Board for each electrode.</p>

<p>The addon has the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can listen to touch and release events</li>
	<li>You can use either the Touch Board touch and release thresholds or use the addon thresholds (useful if you want to control the thresholds in live)</li>
	<li>You can use multiple Touch Boards at the same time</li>
	<li>Works on Raspberry Pi (v1 and v2)</li>
</ul>
